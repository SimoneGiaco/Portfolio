# Portfolio
Projects I have been working on recently: 

The folder 'Transformer' contains the Pytorch code for training a transformer model for language translation.

The folder 'TimeSeries' contains the Tensorflow implementation of a neural network for time series forecasting.

The folder 'SKLearnAlgorithms' contains the code for data analysis of a dataframe with various ML algorithms provided in the Scikit-Learn python library.

The folder 'PINN' contains the Pytorch implementation of a neural network designed to approximate solutions to a differential equation (PINN architecture).
